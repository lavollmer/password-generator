# password-generator

## project description

This project involved making a randomized password generator. In the application, an individual will click the generate button that will be accompanied with a series of questions. Each question answered in the loading page will help create the randomized password. It must include a specific character length and a combination of uppercase, lowercase, special characters and numbers.

This project solves an invidual's challenge in creating a completely randomized secure password. In this project, I learned about functions and loops in javascript. Additionally, I worked on my global scope and local scope for variables understanding.
